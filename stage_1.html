       <p>World wide web (WWW) is a collection of <em>HyperText markup Language (HTML)</em> documents. A typical HTML may contain plain texts, images, videos, music, animations e.t.c.The web was invented in the 1990s and has about 30 Billion pages up to date.</p>

       <p>The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server.The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. This video does a good job of explaining more.</p>  
  
       <p>The picture avbove shows the structure of the internet. Typically, the browser in our computer communicates with the web server(s) through http requests.</p>

        <p>An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. Simple Examples include:</p> 
        
        
        <pre>text bolding: <code><b> text </b></code></pre>
        <br>
        result: <b> text </b>
       

       <pre>text itallics:<code><em> text </em></code></pre>
       <br>
       result: <em> text </em>

       <div class = "content_title">HTML Attributes </div>
  
       <p>Attribute is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the href attribute of an anchor tag-</p>
  
       

        <pre>text link (anchor) - <a href: "www.google.com" > text </a></pre>
        <br>
        result: <a href: "http://www.google.com" > text </a><br>

        <div class = "content_title"> White Spaces </div>

        <pre>text break - <br></pre>
        <pre>text paragraph - <p> text </p></pre>


        <div class = "content_title"> Inline v.s. Block </div>
        
      
        

        </p>For a block, there is a "box" around the content. For inlines, there are no "boxes" around the content.<p>

      <p>The DOCTYPE declaration defines the document type to be HTML.<br>
      The html tag describes an HTML document.<br>
      The head  tag provides information about the document.<br>
      The title tag provides a title for the document.<br>
      The body tag describes the visible page content.<br>
      The head tag describes a heading.<br>
      The p tag describes a paragraph.

Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML 
</div>
      
<br>
<br>

In the world of web, the web consist of HTML that look like living-rooms, bed-rooms, kitchen or a garage. <br>
CSS look like the color and decorations of HTML. JavaScripts function like controls of the lights and doors. <br>
<br>
The fundemental laws of the "web" are <i>tree-structure</i> rules and the <i>box-shape</i>.

    <h7 class = sub_lesson_title><u> CSS </u></h7>

    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same class name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.</p>

    <h1><u>Box Sizing</u></h1>
        
    <p>
        

        HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.

        Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.<br><br>

        There are two techniques we can use to help deal with sizing issues.<br><br>

        1. Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.<br><br>
        
        2. Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.<br><br>
      
        Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.
    
    </p>
    
    <h2><u>Box Positioning</u></h2>
    
    <p>
      Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.<br><br>
      
      Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.
    </p>
    
    
        
      <h8 class = sub_lesson_title> <u>Avoid Repetiton</u> </h8>    
    
        <p>Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.</p>
    
        <p><span><b>Avoiding Errors:</b></span> When programmers don't avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.</p>
      
        <p><span><b>Consistency:</b></span> For example in this webpage, I was able to assign each lesson div the same class and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.</p>
